<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable & Transportable Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The portable and transportable neonatal ventilators market is categorized into invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve procedures that require airway access, such as endotracheal intubation, delivering precise respiratory support to critically ill neonates. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory assistance without intubation, using methods like CPAP or bi-level support, making them less traumatic and easier to use. Both types cater to the distinct needs of neonatal patients in transport situations, ensuring optimal care.</p></p>
