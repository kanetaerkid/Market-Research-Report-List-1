<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ESD-Safe Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionic Type</li><li>Non-ionic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ESD-safe plastics market comprises two main types: ionic and non-ionic. Ionic ESD-safe plastics incorporate additives that neutralize static charge through ionic conductivity, making them suitable for environments where static discharge can damage sensitive electronic components. Non-ionic ESD-safe plastics, on the other hand, rely on surface characteristics to dissipate static without using ionic materials. They are ideal for applications requiring lower conductivity to avoid corrosion while still providing effective static control. Both types ensure safe handling and storage of electronic devices.</p></p>
